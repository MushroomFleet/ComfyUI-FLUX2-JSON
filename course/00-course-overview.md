# FLUX.2 JSON Prompting Mastery
## A Comprehensive Micro-Course for Developers and Prompt Engineers

---

### Course Overview

Welcome to **FLUX.2 JSON Prompting Mastery**, a structured learning path designed to help you unlock the full potential of FLUX.2's advanced prompting capabilities. This course focuses on the revolutionary JSON structured prompting system that gives you unprecedented control over image generation.

### Who This Course Is For

- **Developers** building image generation pipelines and automation workflows
- **Prompt Engineers** seeking precise control over AI-generated imagery
- **Product Designers** requiring brand-consistent visual assets
- **Creative Technologists** exploring the boundaries of AI art direction

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll master:

- **Structured JSON prompting** for pixel-perfect control
- **Hex color integration** for brand consistency
- **Multi-element composition** with precise positioning
- **Camera simulation** for photorealistic outputs
- **Multi-reference techniques** for complex composites
- **Production workflows** and automation strategies

### Course Philosophy

FLUX.2 represents a paradigm shift in prompt engineering. Traditional natural language prompts are powerful but imprecise. JSON structured prompting brings **code-level control** to creative generation, making AI image generation suitable for professional, production-grade workflows where consistency and precision matter.

### Key Differences: FLUX.2 vs. Previous Models

| Aspect | Traditional Models | FLUX.2 |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Prompt Style** | Natural language only | Natural language + JSON structures |
| **Color Control** | Descriptive ("bright red") | Precise hex codes (#FF0000) |
| **Negative Prompts** | Supported | Not supported (describe what you want) |
| **Multi-subject Control** | Limited | Precise per-subject specifications |
| **Reproducibility** | Variable | Highly consistent with structured inputs |
