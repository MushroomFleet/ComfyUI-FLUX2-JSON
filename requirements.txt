# This package has minimal dependencies and uses only Python standard library

# No external dependencies required for Phase 1
# All functionality uses Python built-ins: json, typing

# Future phases may add:
# - colorsys (for color harmony generation) - built-in
# - PIL/Pillow (for image analysis) - ComfyUI dependency
# - numpy (for calculations) - ComfyUI dependency
